# the-hangman-CLImbs
Originally imagined as a mountain climbing term challenge, "the-hangman-CLImbs" is hangman command-line game running via Node.js using advanced JavaScript constructor functions. Once I had convinced myself I have little (no) climbing knowledge the game became a SHAPE challenge.

###Guess the shape in 10 tries (or less)!

Node.js installation is required to run this game. Once cloned/downloaded enter the target directory and run "npm install" to load dependencies followed by "node hangman.js". Enjoy!
