# the-hangman-CLImbs
Originally imagined as a mountain climbing term challenge, **"the-hangman-CLImbs"** is a hangman command-line game running via Node.js using advanced JavaScript constructor functions. Once I had convinced myself I have little *(zero)* climbing knowledge the game became a SHAPE challenge instead.

### Guess the shape in 10 tries (or less)!

Guessing a correct letter does not reduce tries left.

Node.js installation is required to run this game. Once cloned/downloaded enter the target directory and run "npm install" to load dependencies followed by "node hangman.js". Enjoy!
